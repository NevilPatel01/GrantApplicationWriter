### LazyGrant Technologies Inc.
### AI-Powered Grant Application Assistant Platform

---

#### ABSTRACT

LazyGrant Technologies Inc. proposes to develop an AI-native grant writing assistant specifically designed for early-stage startups and entrepreneurs. The platform addresses a critical market gap where 85% of startup founders report missing grant deadlines or abandoning applications due to complexity and time constraints, despite over $60 billion in global public innovation funding being available annually.

Our innovative solution combines advanced Large Language Model (LLM) technology with domain-specific grant writing expertise to create an intelligent, conversational platform that can parse complex institutional grant forms, generate high-quality draft responses, and provide ML-based scoring predictions. Unlike generic AI writing tools, LazyGrant is purpose-built for the grant application lifecycle, featuring grant form parsing capabilities, conversational data collection, smart revision tooling, and continuous learning loops.

The proposed Phase I research will focus on developing core AI algorithms for grant form parsing, establishing conversational AI frameworks for data collection, and creating ML-based scoring models. We anticipate this work will result in a minimum viable product capable of processing standard SBIR/STTR applications with 90% accuracy and reducing application completion time by 75%.

The commercial potential is substantial, with our target market representing over $800 million in current grant consulting services. LazyGrant's B2B SaaS model targets early-stage startups ($29-99/month), accelerators and incubators (enterprise packages), and independent consultants seeking workflow automation. Phase I outcomes will establish technical feasibility and market validation, positioning LazyGrant for Phase II development and commercial deployment.

### 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

#### 1.1 Statement of the Problem

The startup ecosystem faces a fundamental paradox: while billions of dollars in non-dilutive government funding are available through programs like SBIR/STTR, NSF grants, and international innovation funds, the vast majority of early-stage companies cannot effectively access these resources due to the complexity and time requirements of the application process.

Current market research reveals several critical pain points:

**Time and Resource Constraints:** Startup founders, already operating with limited resources, must dedicate 40-80 hours per grant application. For early-stage teams, this represents weeks of diverted attention from core product development and customer acquisition activities.

**Expertise Barriers:** Grant applications require specialized knowledge of federal acquisition regulations, scoring criteria, and agency-specific preferences. Most founders lack this domain expertise, leading to suboptimal applications or complete avoidance of the process.

**Process Complexity:** Grant applications involve multiple components including technical narratives, commercialization plans, budget justifications, and compliance certifications. Each requires different writing styles, formatting requirements, and supporting documentation.

**Limited Support Options:** While grant consultants exist, they charge $5,000-15,000 per application and are often inaccessible to bootstrapped startups. Existing AI writing tools lack the domain-specific knowledge required for technical grant writing.

**Missed Opportunities:** Our preliminary research indicates that 85% of eligible startups have never applied for government grants, representing billions in untapped funding opportunities.

#### 1.2 Technical Innovation and Approach

LazyGrant's technical innovation lies in creating the first AI-native platform specifically designed for grant writing workflows. Our approach combines several breakthrough technologies:

**Grant Form Parsing Engine:** We will develop advanced document processing capabilities that can ingest complex PDF grant forms, extract required fields, understand dependencies between sections, and map user data to appropriate form locations. This involves computer vision for form recognition, natural language processing for requirement extraction, and semantic mapping for data placement.

**Conversational AI Framework:** Rather than traditional form-filling interfaces, LazyGrant employs a conversational approach that mimics working with an expert grant consultant. The system asks targeted questions, clarifies ambiguous responses, and builds comprehensive project profiles through natural dialogue.

**Domain-Specific Language Models:** We will fine-tune existing LLMs on grant-specific corpora including successful applications, agency guidelines, and reviewer feedback. This creates models that understand grant writing conventions, scoring criteria, and agency preferences.

**ML-Based Scoring Prediction:** Our platform will incorporate machine learning models trained on historical grant data to predict application scores and success probabilities. This enables real-time feedback and iterative improvement during the writing process.

**Smart Revision System:** Advanced text analysis capabilities allow users to highlight specific sections and request targeted improvements such as "make this more technical," "align with agency priorities," or "strengthen commercialization potential."

#### 1.3 Research Objectives
